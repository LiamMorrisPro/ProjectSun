This is a small project for exploring the game mechanics behind classic RPG's with creature collecting elements. I'll just be posting the code relevant to what i want to show off.

Just to note some terminology, the creatures of this game are called Spirits, you will be seeing that word a lot, also Dialogue was spelled as Dialog(let's just pretend that was shortform and not a mistake)
